# C++ Raspberry Pi Platform Overview

## Purpose

The C++ Raspberry Pi Platform provides a robust framework for developing hardware-interfacing applications on Raspberry Pi devices. It offers high-level abstractions for GPIO, I2C, and SPI communications while maintaining efficient, low-level access to hardware.

## Key Features

- Hardware abstraction layer for GPIO, I2C, and SPI
- Event-driven architecture
- Real-time capable
- Thread-safe operations
- Configurable logging system
- Error handling framework

## Target Applications

- Industrial automation
- IoT devices
- Sensor networks
- Robotics control systems
- Educational projects
